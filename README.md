# A biomedical example using Juypter notebooks

This repository contains the example Jupyter notebook that accompanies  the article "Encoding medical experiments in Jupyter notebooks" in the chapter "Biomedical databases, standards and medical informatics" of the book ["Systems Medicine: Integrative, Qualitative and
Compuational Approaches"](https://www.elsevier.com/books/systems-medicine/wolkenhauer/978-0-12-816077-0).

The notebook is based on data from the article 

> Tasic, B., Menon, V., Nguyen, T. et al. Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics. Nat Neurosci 19, 335â€“346 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4216

The files [gene_subtypes.csv](gene_subtypes.csv), [S15.txt](S15.txt), and [sample_subgroups.csv](sample_subgroups.csv) have been derived from content of the article, and are part of this repository.

The file "nn.4216-S5.xlsx" can be found in the supplementary material of the article ([supplementary table 3](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnn.4216/MediaObjects/41593_2016_BFnn4216_MOESM71_ESM.xlsx)). After downloading, it needs to be renamed.
